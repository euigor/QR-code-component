## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

It was kinda difficult for me to center the whole thing with CSS and get the idea on how to use Flexbox effectively but overall I believe I did a ok job with what I was given.


```css
.body {
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
	margin: 4rem;
}

.card {
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	border-radius: 0.625rem;
	width: 200px;
	padding: 0.9rem;
	margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

```


### Continued development

My skills with CSS are far from good but I'm determined to improve them each day. 

I might use this project as a template in the future for some QR Code generator that redirects to a hidden document.

### Useful resources

- [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html) - Great documentation overall.
- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es) This helped me to understand better how to use flexbox.
